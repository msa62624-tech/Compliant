/**
 * UI Components
 * 
 * Reusable React components for the Compliant platform.
 * 
 * Note: Most components are currently located in the app directory
 * as Next.js 14 App Router encourages co-location of components with routes.
 * 
 * This directory is reserved for truly shared components that are used
 * across multiple pages and sections of the application.
 * 
 * Examples of components that might live here:
 * - UI primitives (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
 * - Layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
 * - Form components (FormField, FormError, etc.)
 * - Data display (Table, DataGrid, Chart, etc.)
